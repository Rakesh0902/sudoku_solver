In classic sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 blocks contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution

The first half of the program:

I wrote a program  that reads from an Excel file a Sudoku game (clues) and prints it and then a program that reads a proposed solution and verifies if the solution is valid by examining that nine digits from 1 to 9 are shown only once in each row, each column and each of the nine blocks. If the proposed solution is not valid, your program should report rows, columns, and blocks that fail the condition.

the second half of the program:

i Wrote a program that reads a Sudoku puzzle (clues) from an Excel file and prints all possible figures that could be entered in each cell that is not filled yet and then wrote a program that assigns a figure to an empty cell, if that is the only figure that could be entered in that cell.
